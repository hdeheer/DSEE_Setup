The following is from the Sun Directory Server Enterprise Edition 7.0
Administration Guide, chapter 8, Directory Server Backup and Restore.

See scripts/dseeldapservices for automation of the backup process.


Directory backup and restore variables:

	# ${ARCHIVE_DIR} must exist, be empty, owned by ldapadmin.
	# ${PORT} is the LDAP server service port, 1389.
	# ${PASSWORD_FILE} is the path to a file containing just the
	#	Directory Manager's password.
	# ${INSTANCE_PATH} is the instance path of the directory server
	#	instance.

Backup a running directory server instance:

	# The instance should be running.
	dsconf backup -p ${PORT} -w ${PASSWORD_FILE} ${ARCHIVE_DIR}/db
	( cd ${INSTANCE_PATH} && tar cf ${ARCHIVE_DIR}/config.tar config )

Restore a directory server instance:

	# The instance should already be created but not running.
	rm -rf ${INSTANCE_PATH}/config_OLD
	mv -f ${INSTANCE_PATH}/config ${INSTANCE_PATH}/config_OLD
	( cd ${INSTANCE_PATH} && tar xpf ${ARCHIVE_DIR}/config.tar )
	dsadm restore -i ${INSTANCE_PATH} ${ARCHIVE_DIR}/db
